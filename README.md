## 1. Overview
The **lassomodel-starter** is a model starter that makes it simple to build interpretable predictive models via [LASSO](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/sta305files/Rudyregularization.pdf). The advantage of LASSO is that its results are easily interpretable and yet achieve state of the art accuracy. This [**tutorial**](https://zjohn77.github.io/blog/posts/lasso) will review the concepts of LASSO as well as get you started on making a LASSO model using the lassomodel-starter.
